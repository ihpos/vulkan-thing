High Priority

[ ]

Low Priority

[ ] Move to modules (both std and vulkan)
    [ ] Requires LLVM toolchain
        [ ] toolchains_llvm_bootstrapped?
            [ ] Wait for *-windows-msvc support
        [X] BAZEL_LLVM (temporary)
    [ ] Consider Xmake? (https://arewemodulesyet.org/tools/)
        [ ] Find something like Nix that's not Nix

Future

[ ] Reduce dependencies
    [ ] Custom Vulkan loader
